# FER-Net-Leveraging-Attention-Mechanisms-in-EfficintNetB5-model-for-Enhanced-Emotion-Recognition
The research introduces FER-Net, a state-of-the-art facial emotion recognition model that integrates EfficientNetB5 with advanced attention mechanisms. By leveraging augmented image data, we fine-tuned the model with batch normalization, convolutional layers, and dropout techniques, achieving an impressive 87.5% accuracy in emotion detection. Through comparative analysis, our model surpassed other architectures like AlexNet, XceptionNet, ResNet, and MobileNet, showcasing its potential for enhanced human-computer interaction across healthcare, security, and robotics applications.
